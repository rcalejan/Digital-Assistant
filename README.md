## Robert Conrad Alejandre and Kathleen Pham

Welcome to the Personalized Digital Assistant Web App/Page, a comprehensive tool designed to help UCI students stay organized and manage their weekly tasks and plans effectively. This application is tailored to meet the needs of college students by providing a suite of features that streamline task management and enhance productivity.

## Features

### Task List (Checklist)
- **Organize Tasks:** Add, edit, or delete tasks to keep your to-do list up to date. This feature is designed with user control in mind, allowing for a personalized experience.
- **Categorization:** Create and manage different categories for your tasks, such as School tasks, Work tasks, Personal tasks, and Completed tasks.
- **Weekly View:** Display your tasks on a weekly basis, with options to view tasks for this week, next week, or the following week.
- **Sidebar Management:** Keep your to-do lists organized and easily accessible by tucking them away on the side, allowing for a clean and efficient interface (mapping).

### Note Taking Section
- **Accessible Notes:** Access a dedicated section for note-taking, similar to the Notes app on iOS, for longer reminders and freeform text entries.

### Clock/Calendar
- **Time Display:** A continuously active time display is available in the top right corner, allowing users to recognize time without recalling it.
- **Calendar Interface:** The main interface upon logging in, the calendar displays tasks on a monthly scale. Users can add tasks directly from the calendar, automatically applying dates to checklist items.

### Weather API Integration
- **Weather Widget:** A minimal and clean widget displays the current temperature and city location above the calendar.
